              <h3>MOCHACHOS</h3>
              <p>For the past 25 years, Mochachos has become a household brand name loved by the most discerning customers. Known for our dry spiced, flame grilled Mexican chicken, oversized chicken burgers and flavoursome Mexican meals which include an array of chicken or rump steak dishes such as Burritos, Enchiladas, Fajitas and Chimichangas.

                Our inspiration came from the demand from the consumer for “exotic” and healthy dining. We say ‘Spicy but Not Hot’ and offer a variety of flavours to choose… Lemon and Herb, Mild, Hot, Extra Hot and Dynamite. Mochachos chicken provides a well-balanced meal that’s lower in fat and high in protein, without compromising on taste. In fact, it’s for the taste-experience that Mochachos is most famous! Taste the Fiesta and Enjoy!
